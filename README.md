# D Flip-Flop (Verilog)

This repository contains the **gate-level Verilog implementation of a D Flip-Flop**, an essential sequential element in digital design and VLSI systems. The design uses **basic nand logic gate only** — with **no behavioral or dataflow constructs** — making it ideal for foundational learning and **Design-for-Test (DFT)** applications.

-  **Positive Edge-Triggered D Flip-Flop**  
-  **Negative Edge-Triggered D Flip-Flop**  
-  Pure **gate-level modeling** (no `always`, `assign`, or `posedge/negedge`)  
-  Clean, modular design ideal for DFT insertion and scan integration  
-  Beginner-friendly structure for VLSI and RTL design students

## usage

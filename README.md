# Decoder
## What is a Decoder?
A **decoder** is a combinational logic circuit that converts binary input data into a one-hot output format. In simple terms, it "decodes" a binary number into one of several outputs, with only one output active (HIGH) at any time.
## What is a 3-to-8 Decoder?
A **3-to-8 line decoder** takes a 3-bit binary input and activates exactly one of the 8 outputs based on that input.

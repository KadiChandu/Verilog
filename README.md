#  Gate-Level 8x1 Multiplexer (Verilog)
This repository contains a **gate-level Verilog implementation of an 8-to-1 Multiplexer**, a fundamental combinational logic circuit used to select one of 8 input lines based on 3 select signals. The design is built entirely from **primitive gates** making it suitable for **VLSI**, **RTL**, and **Design-for-Test (DFT)** educational use.
##  What is an 8x1 Multiplexer?
An **8x1 MUX** selects **1 of 8 inputs (I0â€“I7)** based on a **3-bit select line (S2, S1, S0)** and forwards it to the output.
##  Usage
- VLSI and RTL Design Labs  
- Digital Logic Design Coursework  
- Combinational Logic Design Practice  
- Foundation for building larger logic systems

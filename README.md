# D Flip-Flop (Verilog)

This repository contains the **gate-level Verilog implementation of a D Flip-Flop**, an essential sequential element in digital design and VLSI systems. The design uses **basic nand logic gate only** â€” with **no behavioral or dataflow constructs** â€” making it ideal for foundational learning and **Design-for-Test (DFT)** applications.

## ðŸ§  Whatâ€™s Included

- âœ… **Positive Edge-Triggered D Flip-Flop**  
- âœ… **Negative Edge-Triggered D Flip-Flop**  
- âœ… Pure **gate-level modeling** (no `always`, `assign`, or `posedge/negedge`)  
- âœ… Clean, modular design ideal for DFT insertion and scan integration  
- âœ… Beginner-friendly structure for VLSI and RTL design students

## ðŸ“š Ideal For

- VLSI/RTL Design Beginners  
- Digital Logic Labs  
- DFT and Scan Chain Introduction  
- Gate-Level Netlist Understanding

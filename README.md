# Gate-Level 8x3 Encoder (Verilog)
This repository contains a **gate-level Verilog implementation of an 8-to-3 Encoder**, a combinational circuit that encodes one of 8 active input lines into a 3-bit binary output. The design uses **only primitive logic gates** â€” ideal for beginners learning **digital logic**, **VLSI fundamentals**, and **Design-for-Test (DFT)** concepts.
## What is an 8x3 Encoder?
An **8-to-3 Encoder** takes **8 input lines** and produces a **3-bit binary code** corresponding to the highest-priority active (high) input line.
